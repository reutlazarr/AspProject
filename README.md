# AspProject

Welcome to the exciting journey of developing our Facbook Interface Project!
This documentation covers everything you need to set up, run, and use the applications involved in our project.

## Introduction

In our work we had 4 steps.
1. We created the bloomfilter - which will be the base for the tcp server.
2. We developed the client environments. one for using on the web, and enother for using app.
3. We developed the server environment in the node - which communicate with all the environment.
4. We connected all the applications to work together.

## Documentation

All detailed documentation for setting up, compiling, and running the applications can be found in the `wiki` directory of this repository. Please refer to these Markdown files for comprehensive guides on how to get started and make the most of the project:
