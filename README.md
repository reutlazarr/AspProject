# AspProject

Welcome to the exciting journey of developing our Facbook Interface Project!
This documentation covers everything you need to set up, run, and use the applications involved in our project.

## Introduction

This project is structured into four main phases, each designed to create a cohesive and functional system:

1. **BloomFilter Development**: Initially, we developed the BloomFilter, which serves as the foundational technology for our TCP server, providing efficient data handling capabilities.
2. **Client Environment Setup**: We crafted two client environments:
   - A web-based interface for accessibility through browsers.
   - A dedicated app for enhanced mobile user engagement.
3. **Server Environment Development**: The server infrastructure was built using Node.js to ensure seamless communication across all client interfaces and the BloomFilter.
4. **Integration**: Finally, we integrated all components to ensure they work synchronously, providing a seamless user experience across different platforms.
